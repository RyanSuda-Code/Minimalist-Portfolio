    Hey, I’m Alex Spencer and I love building beautiful websites

    About Me

    About Me

    I’m a junior front-end developer looking for a new role in an exciting company. 
    I focus on writing accessible HTML, using modern CSS practices and writing clean 
    JavaScript. When writing JavaScript code, I mostly use React, but I can adapt to 
    whatever tools are required. I’m based in London, UK, but I’m happy working remotely 
    and have experience in remote teams. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me outdoors. 
    I love being out in nature whether that’s going for a walk, run or cycling. I’d love 
    you to check out my work.
