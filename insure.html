    Insure

    This was a small project which mostly consisted of HTML and CSS. I built a 
    fully-responsive landing page. The only JavaScript this project required was 
    to enable the toggling of the mobile navigation.

    Project Background

    This project was a front-end  challenge from Frontend Mentor. It’s a platform that 
    enables you to practice building websites to a design and project brief. Each challenge 
    includes mobile and desktop designs to show how the website should look at different 
    screen sizes. Creating these projects has helped me refine my workflow and solve 
    real-world coding problems. I’ve learned something new with each project, helping 
    me to improve and adapt my style.
